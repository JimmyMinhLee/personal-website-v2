# UC Berkeley 

## Overview 

    I was blessed to be able to attend UC Berkeley for undergrad, where I learned a lot about 
    computer science, mentorship, and overall how to be independent. During my time there, I was 
    involved with couple different undergraduate organizations.

My lasting legacy at UC Berkeley was my time with UpSync Consulting, where I grew and built out a lot of the organization's foundations. 
We started as a group of ~20 undergraduates doing contract consulting work for startups, and eventually grew to over ~40 active members working 
with F500 companies. Our semesterly donations totalled over $10,000. Now, the organization works for high-profile clients such as 
Patagonia, Adidas, Nvidia, Nestle, Atlassian, Intuit, with sponsorships from D.E. Shaw & Jane Street.

## ANova 

I was also a member of Berkeley Anova, teaching computer science to youth at high schools & middle schools around the bay area.


## Codeology

And of course, both a project manager & developer for Berkeley Codeology.
