# Ridgeline 

## Overview 

I spent my junior year summer of college working at Ridgeline in Tahoe, Nevada. It was a blessing 
to be able to experience Tahoe while also growing & developing my skills as a software engineer. 
My team worked on the UI components of the application.


import { AnimateChildren } from "@/components/animation/AnimateChildren";
import { Box, List, ListItem, Badge, Divider, HStack, Heading, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";

<Box py={4} >
        <Text size="sm" as="b">
          Languages:
        <Badge>TypeScript</Badge>
        <Badge>Python</Badge>
        </Text>
        <Text size="sm" as="b">
          Technologies:
        <Badge>React</Badge>
        </Text>
</Box>

        <Divider />

<Text pt={2} variant="section-subtitle"> Keyboard Shortcuts </Text>

My major work at Ridgeline was on building out the keyboard shortcuts system in the application. 
We needed to register inputs while also dynamically updating the tooltips wherever needed.

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
        return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}
